# Pokemon encyclopedia

This project was developed to provide information about the current generations of the Pokémon franchise.

I have used this [guideline](https://github.com/honeypotio/challenge/blob/master/tasks/fe_001.md).

The user can navigate through all the Pokémons and check the most important details about the selected Pokémon.

**OBS.:** It's important to say that tough the fact I used the [guideline](https://github.com/honeypotio/challenge/blob/master/tasks/fe_001.md), I didn`t follow all the specifications.

## Project link

You can see the project running in [this link](https://csvinhal.github.io/pokemon-encyclopedia).

**OBS.:** This isn't a full responsible web app, so it is recommended to use large resolutions.
